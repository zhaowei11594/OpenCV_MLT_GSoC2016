#OpenCV - Google Summer of Code 2016 

#Multi-language OpenCV Tutorials in Python, C++ and Java

##Abstract

OpenCV is an open source image processing library extensively used in C++, Python, Java and more than 15 other languages.
With the big variety of supported languages appears the difficulty to find a tutorial in an appropriate language and to write one without duplicating effort or maintenance. In this project we will add the possibility to write multi-language tutorials that a user can later dynamically change to its preferred language if available. We will also unify some existing tutorials and provide an infrastructure for checking the validity of the code used in tutorials. In the end, tutorials will be easier to write, well split between code and meta-data, and most importantly, more valid and language friendly for the user.
